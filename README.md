### Description📄

The coffee shop project is my first project
"This project was developed with NextJs, but I still haven't learned NextJs!"

### Project Description📘

This is my **first personal project**, built with **Next.js**, even though I haven't formally learned the framework yet. The goal was to explore web development hands-on and practice building a simple coffee shop management app.  
I'm still learning, and this project is part of my journey.
